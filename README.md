## Project Description

HospitALL is a smart and unified healthcare management platform.  
It brings together patient information, doctor coordination, and emergency response.  
From appointments to real-time alerts, everything stays in sync.  
The system includes an AI-powered chatbot to assist patients with queries, guidance, and support.  
HospitALL keeps hospitals connected, efficient, and always ready.

## Target Audience

This platform serves as a comprehensive ecosystem connecting patients, healthcare providers, and administrators. It enables patients to access medical services, allows doctors to manage their professional profiles, empowers hospitals to oversee facilities and emergency services, and provides administrators with tools to efficiently manage the entire system. In essence, the project integrates all stakeholders within the healthcare landscape, from individuals seeking care to the institutions delivering it.

## Core Features (AI-Powered)

Our platform features an intelligent AI diagnostic engine designed to assist users in identifying potential health conditions. Users begin by submitting a detailed description of their symptoms through an Input Query. The AI analyzes this information and returns a comprehensive AI Response that includes a curated list of possible conditions.
Beyond diagnostics, the system takes actionable next steps by generating a personalized, dynamic list of recommended doctors and diagnostic tests, helping users move seamlessly from symptom awareness to professional medical care
