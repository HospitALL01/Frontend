## Project Description
HospitALL is a smart and unified healthcare management platform.  
It brings together patient information, doctor coordination, and emergency response.  
From appointments to real-time alerts, everything stays in sync.  
The system includes an AI-powered chatbot to assist patients with queries, guidance, and support.  
HospitALL keeps hospitals connected, efficient, and always ready.

## Target Audience
This platform includes patients seeking medical services, 
doctors managing their professional details, hospitals handling their facilities and emergency services, 
and administrators overseeing the entire system. Essentially, the project is designed for anyone involved in the healthcare ecosystem, 
from the individual seeking care to the institutions providing it.

## Core Features (AI-Powered)
The AI feature is a core component of the platform that helps users define potential diseases. A user enters a detailed description of their symptoms as an Input Query. The AI then processes this information to generate a diagnostic AI Response that includes a list of possible diseases. Crucially, the platform then provides a dynamic list of recommended doctors and tests based on these results, guiding the user toward appropriate medical consultation.

## Project Features
- AI symptom checker gives disease recommendations
- Find doctors by specialty and browse nearby hospital services.
- Book and manage appointments with doctors directly on the platform.
- Read and write reviews to choose the right healthcare provider.
- Request ambulance service from nearby hospitals for urgent situations.
- Manage personal and professional profiles for patients and doctors.
